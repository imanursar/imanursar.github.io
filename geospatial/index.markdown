<div style="text-align: justify">
in this topic, we developed a data-driven tool designed to analyze and visualize the distribution of buyers, potential buyers, and transaction data across specific regions. 

By leveraging this tool, we can generate heat maps that pinpoint high-density areas of demand and transaction volume, offering valuable insights into where logistical improvements can be made.

By utilizing heat maps, we can more accurately identify optimal Cross-Docking that align with buyer and transaction concentrations. These identified zones can then be pursued as cross-docking locations to optimize last-mile logistics.</div>

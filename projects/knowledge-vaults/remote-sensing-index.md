|Code     |name                                       |formula                        |details    |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|NDVI     |The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index | NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)   |It measures the greenness of the vegetation  a remote sensing tool used to assess vegetation health and density by analyzing the reflectance of light in the near-infrared and red wavelengths.   Values close to 1: indicate healthy, dense vegetation. Values close to 0: indicate bare soil, rocks, or sparse vegetation. Negative values: typically indicate water or clouds.       |
|NDRE     |Normalized Difference Red Edge Index       |NDRE = (NIR - RedEdge) / (NIR + RedEdge)                                                                 |a vegetation index used in remote sensing to assess plant health and chlorophyll content. Sensitive to changes in plant chlorophyll content               |
|NIRv     |near-infrared reflectance of vegetation    |NIRv=(NDVI−NDVImin)×NIR  NIRv=NDVI×NIR                                                                   |is a remote sensing index that enhances the measurement of vegetation productivity and greenness by isolating the vegetation signal from the background. It builds upon the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) but tries to correct for the mixed pixel problem (i.e., where pixels contain both vegetation and non-vegetation elements like soil or shadow).                |
|NDMI     |Normalized Difference Moisture Index       |NDMI=(NIR+SWIR) / (NIR−SWIR)   |measures the difference in reflectance between the Near-Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands. Healthy, water-rich vegetation reflects more NIR and less SWIR, while stressed or dry vegetation reflects less NIR and more SWIR.   High NDMI (close to +1): High vegetation moisture, healthy vegetation.  Low NDMI (close to -1): Low moisture, vegetation stress, possible drought.  NDMI ≈ 0: Sparse or dry vegetation, or non-vegetated surfaces like soil or built-up areas.                                             |
|NBR      |Normalized Burn Ratio                      |NBR=(NIR+SWIR) / (NIR−SWIR)    |Detects burn areas and post-fire damage  is a remote sensing index specifically designed to identify burned areas, assess fire severity, and monitor vegetation recovery after wildfires.  Healthy vegetation strongly reflects near-infrared (NIR) and weakly reflects short-wave infrared (SWIR).  Burned areas show reduced NIR reflectance and increased SWIR reflectance due to the charring and loss of biomass and moisture.                               |
|MSI      |The moisture stress index  |MSI=(Band 11 or SWIR 1 / Band 8 or NIR)    |MSI is used to evaluate changes in the water content in vegetation via canopy stress analysis. It is also used to indicate water concentration in soil. Indicates Vegetation Moisture Stress |
|NDWI     |Normalized Difference Water Index          |NDWI=(Green+NIR) / (Green−NIR)  NDWIGao=(NIR+SWIR) / (NIR−SWIR)  MNDWI = (Green - SWIR) / (Green + SWIR) |Identifies water bodies using green and NIR reflectance  to detect open water bodies and surface water extent. Detect water bodies (McFeeters) or vegetation moisture (Gao).  Contrast between vegetation/water and background  NDWI (McFeeters, 1996) — for water body detection. bands B3 (Green) and B8 (NIR)  NDWI (Gao, 1996) — also called NDMI, for vegetation water content.  "The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) uses green and SWIR bands for the enhancement of open water features. It also diminishes built-up area features that are often correlated with open water in other indices.  Positive NDWI (>0): Water Negative NDWI (<0): Soil, vegetation, or built-up areas  -1 to +1 (positive values usually indicate water or moisture)    |
| NDTI    |Normalized Difference Tillage Index        |NDTI=(Red+SWIR1) / (Red−SWIR1) |used primarily to distinguish between tilled and untilled agricultural soil surfaces. It helps monitor soil disturbance, especially in agricultural areas, where identifying recent plowing or tillage is important for land management, erosion studies, and precision agriculture.  Red: Reflectance in the red band (~660 nm) SWIR1: Reflectance in the shortwave infrared band 1 (~1650 nm)  Differentiate bare tilled soil (which tends to reflect more in the red band) from undisturbed or vegetated soil (which tends to reflect more in the SWIR1 band). Support analysis of soil management practices. Assist in erosion risk assessment and soil conservation mapping.  Higher NDTI values (positive): Likely indicate tilled or disturbed soil. Lower NDTI values (negative): Suggest untilled or covered soil, or areas with vegetation or moisture.                                                             |
|NDTI (for water)     |  | (RED - GREEN) / (RED + GREEN) | Detects Turbidity Or Sediment In Water |
|WRI      |Water Ratio Index                          |WRI=(NIR+SWIR) / (Green+Red) or (Green+Red) / (NIR + SWIR)   |is a simple and effective remote sensing index used to detect open surface water bodies in satellite imagery. It helps distinguish water from non-water features such as soil, vegetation, and built-up areas based on their reflectance characteristics.  Total surface reflectance behavior (combined bands)  WRI leverages the fact that water absorbs more in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands, and reflects more in the green and red parts of the spectrum. In contrast, soil and vegetation behave differently, allowing for separation.  WRI > 1 → Likely water bodies  WRI < 1 → Likely non-water surfaces (vegetation, soil, urban)  Typically >1 for water, <1 for non-water  Note: Thresholds may vary slightly depending on atmospheric conditions and sensor characteristics, so it’s often calibrated for specific regions or imagery.  Fast water detection (e.g., floods, rivers)|
|AWEI     |Automated Water Extraction Index           |0.304 × (Green) + 0.474 × (SWIR1) + 0.050 (Blue) - 0.250 × (NIR)                                         |Detects water bodies with multiple spectral bands.                              |
|NDSI     |Normalized Difference Snow Index           |(Green - SWIR)/ (Green + SWIR) |Detects snow by green and SWIR reflectance.  Detects snow cover by differentiating snow from clouds and water. Ideal for snowpack monitoring and climate studies.                                                                   |

|LSWI     |                                           |(NIR-SWIR)/(NIR + SWIR)        |Sensitive to water content in vegetation and soil. Estimates soil properties like moisture and texture                                                    |

|DVI      |                                           |NIR - Red                      |Calculates the difference between NIR and red bands                             |
|SAVI     |Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index             |SAVI=(1+L)⋅(NIR−Red) / (NIR+Red+L)  |Reduces soil effects in sparse vegetation areas  is a remote sensing index designed to minimize the influence of soil brightness when measuring vegetation greenness, especially in areas where vegetation cover is sparse.  NDVI can be inaccurate in regions with low vegetation because the soil reflectance affects both the red and NIR signals. SAVI corrects this by introducing a soil adjustment factor to reduce soil background effects.  NIR = Reflectance in the Near-Infrared band (e.g., ~850 nm)  Red = Reflectance in the Red band (e.g., ~660 nm)  L = Soil adjustment factor (ranges from 0 to 1)  L = 0 → SAVI becomes NDVI (used when vegetation is dense)  L = 0.5 → Commonly used default (for intermediate vegetation)  L = 1 → Used in very sparse vegetation  Higher values indicate more green vegetation.  Lower or negative values suggest bare soil, dry vegetation, or non-vegetated surfaces. |

## Why Leading Through Change is Hard

- **People Fear The Unknown** - Change disrupts comfort zones and routines, making people anxious about what's next.
- **Change Creates Confusion** - Without clear communication from leadership, confusion reigns. Everyone needs to know the "why" and "how" of the change.
- **Culture Is Stubborn** - Habits run deep. Changing the way things have always been done is challenging.
- **Resources Are Limited** - Change demands time, money, and people. Balancing these with other priorities requires skill.
- **Weak Leadership Shows** - Leaders must be fully committed and consistent in their messages to avoid mixed signals.
- **Emotions Run High** - Change creates stress and fear about job security, which can derail efforts if not managed well.

## Steps To Lead Through Change

- **Lead By Example** - Leaders need to be 100% committed to change that you want from others.
- **Set A Very Clear Unifying Goal** - Set a simple clear goal that the team can understand and get behind.
- **Provide Emotional Support** - Focus on your people's emotions, and provide the support they need.
- **Explain The "Why"** - Explain clearly why change is needed and why things aren't working.
- **Be Open About The Challenges But Stay Positive** - Share the challenges and inspire confidence in your ability to deliver change.
- **Collect Feedback** - Always ask questions, continue to collect feedback.
- **Communicate Calmly** - Your stress (and calmness) are contagious.

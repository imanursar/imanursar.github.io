## The 10/10/10 Rule
Evaluate the consequences of decisions in the short, medium, and long term.
-  How will you feel about the decision in 10 minutes
-  How will you feel about it in 10 months?
-  How about in 10 years?

## The Ben Franklin Method
Named after Benjamin Franklin who described the method in a letter, it involves dividing a sheet of paper into two columns (pros and cons). 

After listing down points for each side, take a break. then revisit the list to see which points stand out.

The break in between is essential; it allows for reflection and emotional distancing.

## The Six Thinking Hats
This method encourages you to approach a decision from six different perspectives. Each "hat" represents a distinct way of thinking.

PRO TIP: Using the method in group settings can be highly effective; each person adopts a specific hat to provide a focused perspective.

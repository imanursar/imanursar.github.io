## Why Leading Through Change is Hard

- **People Fear The Unknown** - Change disrupts comfort zones and routines, making people anxious about what's next.
- **Change Creates Confusion** - Without clear communication from leadership, confusion reigns. Everyone needs to know the "why" and "how" of the change.
- **Culture Is Stubborn** - Habits run deep. Changing the way things have always been done is challenging.
- **Resources Are Limited** - Change demands time, money, and people. Balancing these with other priorities requires skill.
- **Weak Leadership Shows** - Leaders must be fully committed and consistent in their messages to avoid mixed signals.
- **Emotions Run High** - Change creates stress and fear about job security, which can derail efforts if not managed well.

## Steps To Lead Through Change

- **Lead By Example** - Leaders need to be 100% committed to change that you want from others.
- **Set A Very Clear Unifying Goal** - Set a simple clear goal that the team can understand and get behind.
- **Provide Emotional Support** - Focus on your people's emotions, and provide the support they need.
- **Explain The "Why"** - Explain clearly why change is needed and why things aren't working.
- **Be Open About The Challenges But Stay Positive** - Share the challenges and inspire confidence in your ability to deliver change.
- **Collect Feedback** - Always ask questions, continue to collect feedback.
- **Communicate Calmly** - Your stress (and calmness) are contagious.

## Use Cases

- **When Someone Says, "This Won't Work"**
  - X Don't: Shut them down
  - ✓ Do: Ask, "What part feels risky to you?"
  - Pushback often signals perceived risk, not defiance.
- **When Someone Pushes Back Immediately**
  - X Don't: Argue or rush to explain
  - ✓ Do: Say, "That's a fair concern. Let's unpack it together."
  - Feeling dismissed activates the brain's threat response.
- **When You First Announce the Change**
  - X Don't: Start with timelines and business goals
  - ✓ Do: Start with what it means for them - clarity, growth, less stress
  - If it doesn't feel personally relevant, the brain deprioritizes it. 
- **When You Feel Defensive**
  - X Don't: Talk over people or double down
  - ✓ Do: Pause. Ask, "What's unclear or concerning right now?"
  - Calm questions reduce threat perception and invite openness.
- **When a Key Team Member Goes Quiet**
  - X Don't: Assume silence means agreement
  - ✓ Do: Ask privately, "What's your honest take on this?"
  - Silence often reflects low psychological safety, not support.
- **When Team Energy Drops**
  - X Don't: Pretend everything's fine
  - ✓ Do: Say, "This change is hard, and that's normal."
  - Naming emotions reduces brain reactivity and helps people process.
- **When Sharing the Plan**
  - X Don't: Overwhelm with jargon or slides
  - ✓ Do: Be clear, "Here's what's changing and why it matters."
  - Ambiguity increases anxiety and slows decision-making.
- **When People Go Quietly Passive**
  - X Don't: Call them out publicly
  - ✓ Do: Follow up one-on-one and offer a clear next step
  - Small wins release dopamine and build momentum.
- **When You Want Long-Term Buy-In**
  - X Don't: Treat it like a one- time announcement
  - ✓ Do: Repeat the "why" and show visible progress
  - Repetition and short-term wins reinforce belief and drive habit formation.

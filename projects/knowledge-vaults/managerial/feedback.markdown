Giving feedback is an essential skill to learn. It builds trust. It helps teams grow. It shows what's working and what's not. Good feedback can boost your team's performance and job satisfaction.


## Giving Feedback

- **Be Positive**
- **Be Specific** - Focus on specific issues so that it is clear where performance was insufficient.
- **Provide Reguler Feedback** - To the greatest extent possible, a worker should always know how they're performing in their role.
- **Deliver Feedback Privately** - Show employees that you aim to foster improvement, not to demonstrate your authority or attack their character.
- **Set Development Targets** - By creating measurable and achievable targets, there is a clear way to track improvements.


## Receiving Feedback

- **Constructive Criticism is necessary** - Everyone will have to deal with negative feedback during their career. It is how you respond to this criticism that will define you.
- **Try and Find Common Ground** - Accepting failure and committing to changes will help you to move forward.
- **Set Feedback As A Positive** - Those who fail to see feedback as constructive often lose morale and are far less likely to improve as a result.


## How to Give Feedback Model

### SBI Model
Highly actionable and straightforward. Good for performance improvement.

- **Situation** - Explain the situation. Ex: During yesterday's team meeting.
- **Behaviour** - Describe the behaviour. Ex: I noticed you interrupted a few times.
- **Impact** - Share the impact. Ex: It made your teammates feel unheard.

### COIN Model
Emphasizes relationship-building alongside feedback.

- **Connect** - Establish rapport. Ex: Great work on the project last week.
- **Observe** - Share observations. Ex: I noticed you took the lead without being asked.
- **Impact** - Discuss the impact. Ex: It kept the team organized and we hit the deadline.
- **Next Steps** - Agree on actions. Ex: Keep taking Initiative. It's making a difference.


### GROW Model
Consultative approach that gives feedback with coaching.

- **Goal** - Define the objective. Ex: Our goal is to increase team output by 10% this quarter.
- **Reality** - Assess the situation. Ex: We're currently at a 10% increase and need to improve. What can we do?
- **Options** - Explore various options. Ex: We could have each person do a time audit or hold more training sessions.
- **Way Forward** - Decide on next steps. Ex: Let's start with a time audit and see where we're at in two weeks.


### CEDAR Model
Comprehensive deep-dive useful for complex issues.

- **Context** - Where and when the behaviour occurred. Ex: While working on the marketing campaign. 
- **Examples** - Specific instances of what happened. Ex: I saw you missed two important deadlines. 
- **Diagnosis** - Your interpretation of the situation. Ex: It resulted in our launch being delayed.
- **Action** - What needs to change. Ex: I want you to prioritise your tasks better.
- **Review** - How you will follow up. Ex: We'll assess your progress in two weeks.

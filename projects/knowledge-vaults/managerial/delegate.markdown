## The Levels of Delegation Framework
Use 7 levels of delegation to decide how much control to give:

- **Tell** - You decide and inform.
- **Sell** - You decide, but explain your reasoning.
- **Consult** - You seek input but decide.
- **Agree** - You and the team decide together.
- **Advise** - They decide, but you provide input.
- **Inquire** - They decide, and you ask for updates.
- **Delegate** - Full ownership is theirs.

This ensures the right balance of autonomy and oversight.

## The Leadership Pipeline Model
This model emphasizes shifting from "doing" to "leading":
- At the **operational level**, delegate routine tasks to focus on results.
- At the **managerial level**, delegate decisions to empower your team.
- At the **leadership level**, delegate ownership of initiatives to develop future leaders.

## RACI Framework
Define clear roles for every task:

- **Responsible**: The person doing the work.
- **Accountable**: The person ensuring the task is completed.
- **Consulted**: Stakeholders providing input.
- **Informed**: Those who need updates.

This ensures clarity and avoids misunderstandings.

## Practical Tips

1. **Be Clear About What You Need**: Explain the task, the deadline, and the specific result you're expecting. Don't leave room for guesswork. For example: "I need a one- page summary of our Q1 sales trends by Thursday. Focus on the biggest wins and challenges."
2. **Pick the Right Person for the Job**: Assign tasks based on strengths, skills, and availability. For example: "Since you've done similar projects before, I'd like you to handle this analysis."
3. **Provide What They Need to Get Started**: Set them up with the right tools, resources, or context. For example: "Here's a link to the raw data. I've also included last quarter's report so you have a reference."
4. **Set Progress Checkpoints**: Avoid last-minute surprises by scheduling quick updates. For example: "Let's check in on Tuesday to review the outline and see if you're on track."
5. **Be Available Without Micromanaging**: Let them know you're there for support if needed but trust them to take the lead. For example: "If you run into roadblocks, send me a quick email and we'll tackle it together."
6. **Recognize and Reflect Afterward**: Thank them for their effort and discuss what went well or could improve. For example: "Your presentation was well-researched and clear. Next time, let's include visuals to make it even stronger."

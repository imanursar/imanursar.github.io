## Introduction
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Data management is not a single discipline—it is an organized practice that integrates technical precision, governance, and operational intent. It recognizes that data is a core business asset, not an IT byproduct. Managing data means managing its entire lifecycle: creation, storage, transformation, use, and retirement. Each stage requires accountability, consistency, and alignment with the organization’s operational and strategic objectives. Without structure, data becomes noise; without discipline, it loses trust and value.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Effective data management depends on diverse skills across analytics, engineering, governance, and leadership. It is both a technical and cultural function that demands sustained commitment from decision-makers. Business requirements define what data management must achieve, not the other way around. A sound strategy ensures data supports every critical process with clarity, integrity, and reliability. Leadership must drive this commitment—because no technology or framework can compensate for the absence of direction and ownership.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Data management is not a single discipline — it is an organized practice that integrates technical precision, governance, and operational intent. It recognizes that data is a core business asset, not an IT byproduct. Managing data means managing its entire lifecycle: creation, storage, transformation, use, and retirement. Each stage requires accountability, consistency, and alignment with the organization’s operational and strategic objectives. Without structure, data becomes noise; without discipline, it loses trust and value.</p>

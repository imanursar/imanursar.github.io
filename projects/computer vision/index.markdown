### What Is YOLO?
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
YOLO is a family of object detection algorithms widely used in computer vision tasks such as vehicle detection in traffic cameras, face recognition in security systems, and wildlife monitoring from drones. Unlike traditional methods that process regions separately, YOLO treats detection as a single regression problem. It looks at the entire image once and directly predicts object locations and classes in a single forward pass, making it much faster and more efficient for real-time applications.

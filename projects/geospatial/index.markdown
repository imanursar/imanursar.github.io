### What is spatial data science?
spatial data science is a process to **solving problems what relate to spatial algorithms and geographical data (location, address, longlat, etc)**.

<div style="text-align: justify">
in this topic, we developed a data-driven tool designed to analyze and visualize the distribution of buyers, potential buyers, and transaction data across specific regions. 

By leveraging this tool, we can generate heat maps that pinpoint high-density areas of demand and transaction volume, offering valuable insights into where logistical improvements can be made.

By utilizing heat maps, we can more accurately identify optimal Cross-Docking that align with buyer and transaction concentrations. These identified zones can then be pursued as cross-docking locations to optimize last-mile logistics.</div>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This project focuses on the one of critical part of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), which is testing for spatial structure present within data.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Testing for spatial structure is important because if it is present in data, then we’ll want to leverage that spatial structure to enhance our downstream analysis. This can be done by using specialized algorithms during a model-building process that can understand patterns from both data and geographic space.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Finding the perfect place to live isn’t just about personal preferences—it’s also about the environment, opportunities, and overall quality of life a neighborhood can offer. The Simple Livability Index aims to provide a clear, data-driven way to compare different city districts, scoring each one from 1 to 10 based on key livability factors.</p>

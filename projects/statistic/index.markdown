<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Previously, we explored how to calculate the distance between multiple locations in a spatial context, focusing on geographical measurements such as <b>Euclidean distance or Haversine formula</b> for calculating the separation between two latitude-longitude points. <a href="https://imanursar.github.io/geospatial/distance">Read more here</a>. However, distance measurement extends far beyond just physical space.

In this section, we dive deeper into various mathematical distance metrics that are widely used in different domains, including text similarity, clustering, and machine learning. Each method serves a unique purpose, whether in <b>natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems, image recognition, or statistical analysis</b>.

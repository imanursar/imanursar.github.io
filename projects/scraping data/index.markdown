### Introduction
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To grow our acquisition efforts and truly understand the market potential—both for Upstream and downstream buyers— we need access to the right data. This means identifying and targeting untapped potential customers, whether they are small-scale farmers, distributors, or retailers who haven't yet been engaged with our platform.</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>One of the most effective ways to gather this data is through data scraping, particularly from sources like Google Maps API. By utilizing Google Maps, we can collect valuable information about businesses, locations, and customer segments in both upstream and downstream markets.</p>

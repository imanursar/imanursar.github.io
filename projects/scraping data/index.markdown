### Introduction
<p style='text-align: justify;'>To grow our acquisition efforts and truly understand the market potential—both for Upstream and downstream buyers— we need access to the right data. This means identifying and targeting untapped potential customers, whether they are small-scale farmers, distributors, or retailers who haven't yet been engaged with our platform.</p>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>One of the most effective ways to gather this data is through data scraping, particularly from sources like Google Maps API. By utilizing Google Maps, we can collect valuable information about businesses, locations, and customer segments in both upstream and downstream markets.</p>

### Introduction
<p style='text-align: justify;'>When you're looking for places around you—whether it's coffee shops, ATMs, parks, or gas stations—you’re essentially looking for Points of Interest (POIs). These are specific locations that serve a purpose for people, like businesses, landmarks, or public facilities. One of the best ways to fetch and analyze POIs is by using OpenStreetMap (OSM), a rich, community-driven map database.</p>
